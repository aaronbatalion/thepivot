== Description 
s5 is an awesome browser based slide show project. slidy is an JS extension for CSS3 transitions.

I've extended the s5/slidy JS/CSS to be Takahashi-method-esque but mostly to be the easiest presentation a geek ever wrote.

#Conventions

- Each slide is a <div class="slide">
- Each slide has a background image (class = "background")
- 5 classes to position text.  
 - tr_quote (top right)
 - tl_quote (top left)
 - br_quote (bottom right)
 - bl_quote (bottom left)
 - c_quote (center)
- One offs for positioning are done inline.
