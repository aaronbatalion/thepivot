Takahashi-s5

== Description 
Takahashi-s5 is an extension to s5/slidy to let geeks write presentations easily. 

I wrote this for a talk after getting frustrated with Keynote.

== Conventions
- Each slide is a <div class="slide">
- Each slide has a background image (class = "background")
- 5 classes to position text.  
 - tr_quote (top right)
 - tl_quote (top left)
 - br_quote (bottom right)
 - bl_quote (bottom left)
 - c_quote (center)
- One offs for positioning are done inline.


== Create your own
- Clone the project
- modify index.html
